            <h2>Why Tokyo?</h2>
            <h3>Tokyo, the largest city in the world</h3>
            <p>
              Tokyo, the capital of Japan, is without a doubt the world‚Äôs
              largest city in terms of population. Tokyo is home to more than 13
              million inhabitants, and its metropolitan area is home to more
              than 37 million people, making it a megalopolis without equal in
              terms of population density.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is a city with a thousand faces, where modernity sits
              harmoniously alongside tradition. The contrast between ancient
              temples and gleaming skyscrapers is striking. Japan has a rich
              history, and Tokyo is no exception.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tokyo is divided into many districts, each with its own charm and
              distinct personality. Shibuya is famous for its crossroads, one of
              the busiest in the world, and its lively atmosphere, while
              Akihabara is a technology nut‚Äôs paradise, with its electronic
              shops and manga caf√©s. Harajuku is the home of eccentric fashion,
              with young people walking around in highly original outfits. And
              remember to visit Shinjuku, one of Tokyo‚Äôs liveliest districts,
              with its towering skyscrapers, luxury shops and famous Shinjuku
              Gyoen park for a break from the concrete jungle. At night, Tokyo
              comes alive with an entirely different kind of atmosphere. Secret
              cocktail bars, exuberant nightclubs and karaoke bars abound. The
              Roppongi district is renowned for its international nightlife,
              while Shibuya and Shinjuku offer an endless variety of options for
              having fun until the early hours.

                <h4>Shibuya Crossing</h4>
                <p>
                  It is the world‚Äôs busiest intersection. Massive video screens
                  flashing advertisements tower above every corner as salarymen,
                  tourists, and shoppers wait and cross in concert. The feeling
                  is oddly soothing, a reminder that whatever our disparate
                  paths in life, they all have a tendency to cross at one time
                  or another. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                  The best time to go is at dusk, one of the
                  scramble‚Äôs peak times and in its most flattering light. The
                  Shibuya Scramble Square tower offers a birds‚Äô eye view, along
                  with panoramic views of the city from the Shibuya Sky rooftop
                  observatory.

                  <strong> Curiosity: </strong> Most of the scenes in the
                  Netflix series <q>Alice in Boderland</q> were filmed at the
                  crossing.

                <p>
                  Sensoji (also known as Asakusa Kannon Temple) is a Buddhist temple located in Asakusa. It is one of Tokyo's most colorful and popular temples.
                </p>
                <p>
                The temple was built nearby for the goddess of Kannon and it was completed in 645, making it Tokyo's oldest temple.
                </p>
                <p>
                Various events are held throughout the year in the Sensoji Temple area. The biggest of them is the Sanja Matsuri, the annual festival of the Asakusa Shrine, held in May. Other events are the Asakusa Samba Carnival in August and the Hagoita-ichi (Hagoita Market) at which decorated wooden paddles used in the traditional game of hanetsuki are sold.

                <p>
               Tokyo Skytree is a broadcasting and observation tower in Sumida, Tokyo. It became the tallest tower in Japan in 2010 and reached its full height of 634 meters in March 2011, making it the tallest tower in the world and the third tallest structure in the world. 
                </p>
                <p>
The main attraction at Tokyo Skytree is the staggering view from the observation decks. There‚Äôs two: the lower deck (Tembo Deck) at 350 meters and the upper deck (Tembo Galleria) at 450 meters. At the base there‚Äôs a mall called Solamachi with a good selection of shops, cafes, and restaurants at a variety of price points.                </p>
<p>
     Tembo Deck gives you an awesome view over the city ‚Äî and all the way to Mount Fuji on clear days.
