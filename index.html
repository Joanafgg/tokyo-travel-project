      <h2> Why Tokyo?</h2>
      <h3>Tokyo, the largest city in the world</h3>
      <p>
        Tokyo, the capital of Japan, is without a doubt the worldâ€™s largest city in terms of population. Tokyo is home to more than 13 million inhabitants, and its metropolitan area is home to more than 37 million people, making it a megalopolis without equal in terms of population density.
      </p>
      <p> 
      It is a city with a thousand faces, where modernity sits harmoniously alongside tradition. The contrast between ancient temples and gleaming skyscrapers is striking. 
Japan has a rich history, and Tokyo is no exception. 
</p>    
<p>Tokyo is divided into many districts, each with its own charm and distinct personality. Shibuya is famous for its crossroads, one of the busiest in the world, and its lively atmosphere, while Akihabara is a technology nutâ€™s paradise, with its electronic shops and manga cafÃ©s. Harajuku is the home of eccentric fashion, with young people walking around in highly original outfits. And remember to visit Shinjuku, one of Tokyoâ€™s liveliest districts, with its towering skyscrapers, luxury shops and famous Shinjuku Gyoen park for a break from the concrete jungle.

At night, Tokyo comes alive with an entirely different kind of atmosphere. Secret cocktail bars, exuberant nightclubs and karaoke bars abound. The Roppongi district is renowned for its international nightlife, while Shibuya and Shinjuku offer an endless variety of options for having fun until the early hours.</p>
